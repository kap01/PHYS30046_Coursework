    "### The purpose of this exercise is to gain a deeper understanding of the electroweak interaction. We will use real data from the CMS experiment at the LHC to extract the weak mixing angle $\\sin^2\\theta_W$, one of the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model. This will be achieved by fitting a theoretical expression for the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ of di-muon pairs to a measured $A_{FB}$ distribution obtained from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework will require you to download all files contained in the following link **[[Input files]](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/kp14102_bristol_ac_uk/EogitLtkOqZBleDd2RR8fF4B6KfO_X4jzsSkp2ekYHHATw?e=9mNFso)** and place **ALL** these files in the same directory as this notebook.\n",

    "Just as in the previous exercise, we will analyse events in which a Z boson was produced that subsequently decays to a pair of muons. The data [1,2] has been preselected for you and can be found in the file `cms_muons.root`.\n",

    "The measurement we are about to carry out follows (*with some simplifications!*) what is described **in this [CMS paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6148-7)** [3]. In particular the introduction of this paper describes how the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ of the di-muon pairs is related to the vector- and axial-vector couplings, and thus to $\\sin^2\\theta_W$. **As a minimum, you will need to read the introduction of this paper but other sections will be helpful as well.** \n",
    "\n",
    "For some theoretical background on the electroweak mixing angle, take a look at Chapters 15.3 through to 16.2 in the textbook *Modern Particle Physics* by Thomson (Cambridge University Press). **In particular Chapter 16.2.2 is relevant for this exercise** but a key difference is that it discusses this measurement at an electron-positron collider, and not at a hadron collider such as the LHC.  \n",

    "Unlike at LEP, where the polar angle of the scattered muons is measured with respect to the incoming electron-positron pair, we need to consider the directions and momenta of the quark-antiquark pair at a hadron collider such as the LHC. In general, as a result of different incoming quark and anti-quark momenta, the rest frame of the produced Z boson is not the same as the laboratory frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the scattering angle $\\cos\\theta^*$ as the cosine of the polar angle of the negatively charged muon ($\\mu^-$) in the vector boson’s rest frame (the Collins–Soper frame). This measures how “forward” ($\\cos\\theta^* > 0$) or “backward” ($\\cos\\theta^* < 0$) the lepton is emitted relative to the incoming quark direction.\n",
